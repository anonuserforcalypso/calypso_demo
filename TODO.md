This is a list of things to do - please help me prioritize it:
- finish README.md
- add some comments to the UI (how to edit DARCs)
- click on filename to see linked DARC
- make the blockchain explorer a little bit nicer:
  - use all space
  - add arrows instead of "back" and "forward"
- add Calypso-logging
- other?
